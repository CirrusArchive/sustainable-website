			<p class="lead">  Responsible consumption and production emerged through the collaborative
                efforts of many groups over several decades rather than a single founder.
                The concept was shaped by early environmental scientists, consumer-rights
                advocates, and influential thinkers like Rachel Carson, E.F. Schumacher,
                and Herman Daly, who exposed the ecological and social impacts of modern
                production. Governments, NGOs, and global organizations also played major
                roles, especially during the 1987 Brundtland Commission—which introduced
                sustainable development—and the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, where nations formally
                recognized the need for sustainable consumption and production patterns.
                Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, the United Nations, particularly UNEP and
                UN DESA, worked with countries, researchers, and civil society to develop
                global guidelines, ultimately establishing Responsible Consumption and Production
                as Sustainable Development Goal 12 in 2015.
