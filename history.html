	<h1> The history of Responsible Consumption and Production </h1>
	<p> Responsible consumption and production emerged through the collaborative efforts of many groups over several decades rather than a single founder. The concept was shaped by early environmental scientists, consumer-rights advocates, and influential thinkers like Rachel Carson, E.F. Schumacher, and Herman Daly, who exposed the ecological and social impacts of modern production. Governments, NGOs, and global organizations also played major roles, especially during the 1987 Brundtland Commission—which introduced sustainable development—and the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, where nations formally recognized the need for sustainable consumption and production patterns. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, the United Nations, particularly UNEP and UN DESA, worked with countries, researchers, and civil society to develop global guidelines, ultimately establishing Responsible Consumption and Production as Sustainable Development Goal 12 in 2015. Together, these diverse contributors created the modern framework that guides responsible use of resources, ethical production systems, and sustainable lifestyles worldwide.<p>
